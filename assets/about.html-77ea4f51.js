We recognize that no one person or team has all the answers, and that solutions often arise through the collective efforts and insights of diverse groups. We encourage our teams to collaborate across various fields and leverage the expertise of external partners when necessary to arrive at comprehensive solutions that address all facets of an issue.</p><h3 id="our-emphasis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#our-emphasis" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Our emphasis</h3><p>Furthermore, we place a strong emphasis on continuous improvement and learning.
